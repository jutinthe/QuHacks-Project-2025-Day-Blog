                    Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that was developed by Guido Van Rossum. Its design philosophy uses a lot of indentation to make the code easy to read.

                    Python has garbage collection and dynamic type checking. It supports a variety of programming paradigms, such as object-oriented, functional, and structured programming, especially procedural programming. Because of its extensive standard library, it is frequently referred to as a "batteries included" language.

            A style sheet language called Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to define how a document produced in a markup language like HTML or XML (including XML dialects like SVG, MathML, or XHTML) should be presented and styled. The World Wide Web's foundational technologies include HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.
        </p> 
        <p class="p3">
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.This separation can improve content accessibility, since the content can be written without concern for its presentation; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

            Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript, a programming language.
        </p>
        <p class=""p3>
Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.
